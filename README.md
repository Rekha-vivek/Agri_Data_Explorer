# Indian Agriculture Data Explorer

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes Indian agricultural data to understand crop production, cultivated area, and yield trends across different states and districts. The objective is to extract meaningful insights using data analysis and visualization techniques to support data-driven agricultural planning and decision-making.

Major crops analyzed include Rice, Wheat, Maize, Cotton, Sugarcane, Oilseeds, Groundnut, Soybean, and Millets.

## 🔍 Key Insights & Analysis

### 1. Rice Production Trend (Top 3 States)

The leading rice-producing states show a consistent upward trend, with northern and eastern states contributing the majority of national production.

### 2. Wheat Yield Improvement

Top-performing districts demonstrate strong yield growth, indicating efficiency improvements rather than only land expansion.

### 3. Oilseed Growth

Oilseed production growth is uneven across states, highlighting the need for region-specific agricultural support.

### 4. Area–Production Relationship

Most districts show strong positive correlation, confirming that increased cultivated area generally leads to higher production.

### 5. Cotton Production Trend

Cotton production shows long-term growth with noticeable year-to-year fluctuations due to climatic and irrigation factors.

### 6. Groundnut Production (2017)

Groundnut cultivation is highly concentrated in a few productive districts.

### 7. Maize Yield Trend

The national average maize yield has gradually improved over time, indicating productivity enhancement.

### 8. Oilseed Cultivation Area

A small number of states account for the majority of oilseed cultivation area.

### 9. Rice Yield Leaders

High-yield districts achieve better output per hectare, proving that efficiency is more important than land size.

### 10. Wheat vs Rice Comparison

Both crops show long-term growth, with rice displaying more stability and wheat showing higher variability.
